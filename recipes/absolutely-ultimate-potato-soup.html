    <h1>Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title. It takes a bit of effort but is well worth
        it.
        Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and
        continue
        with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting
        calories.)</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to
            10 minutes.
            Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
        <li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
            Stir in
            garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough
            chicken stock to
            just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1
            to 2
            minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.</li>
        <li>
            Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream
            mixture to the
            potato mixture; stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
